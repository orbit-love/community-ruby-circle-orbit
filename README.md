|-----------------------------------------|

![There are three ways to use this integration. Install package - build and run your own applications. Run the CLI - run on-demand directly from your terminal. Schedule an automation with GitHub - get started in minutes - no coding required](readme-images/ways-to-use.png)

## First Time Setup

To set up this integration you will need your Circle API key and your Circle community URL. See the below table for instructions on where to find it, along with your Orbit API credentials.
## Application Credentials

The application requires the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | More Info
|---|---|--|
| `CIRCLE_API_KEY` | Circle API key | Create a new API key in the API section in your User Settings
| `CIRCLE_URL`     | Circle community URL | This is your Circle custom URL, for example: `https://orbit.circle.so`
| `ORBIT_API_KEY` | API key for Orbit | Found in `Account Settings` in your Orbit workspace
| `ORBIT_WORKSPACE_ID` | ID for your Orbit workspace | Last part of the Orbit workspace URL, i.e. `https://app.orbit.love/my-workspace`, the ID is `my-workspace`

## Package Usage

Install the package with the following command

```
$ gem install circle_orbit
```

Then, run `bundle install` from your terminal.

You can instantiate a client by either passing in the required credentials during instantiation or by providing them in your `.env` file.

### Instantiation with credentials:

```ruby
client = CircleOrbit::Client.new(
    orbit_api_key: YOUR_API_KEY,
    orbit_workspace_id: YOUR_ORBIT_WORKSPACE_ID,
    circle_api_key: YOUR_CIRCLE_API_KEY,
    circle_url: YOUR_CIRCLE_URL
)
```
### Instantiation with credentials in dotenv file:

```ruby
client = CircleOrbit::Client.new
```
### Performing a Historical Import

You may want to perform a one-time historical import to fetch all your previous Circle interactions and bring them into your Orbit workspace. To do so, instantiate your `client` with the `historical_import` flag:

```ruby
client = CircleOrbit::Client.new(
  historical_import: true
)
```
### Post New Spaces Posts to Orbit Workspace

You can use the gem to get new posts in your Circle Spaces and share them as custom activities to your Orbit workspace by using the `#posts` method on your `client instance`:

```ruby
client.posts
```

### Post New Spaces Comments to Orbit Workspace

You can use the gem to get new comments on posts in your Circle Spaces and share them as custom activities to your Orbit workspace by using the `#posts` method on your `client instance`:

```ruby
client.comments
```
## CLI Usage

You can also use this package with the included CLI. To use the CLI pass in the required environment variables on the command line before invoking the CLI.

To check for new posts:

```bash
$ ORBIT_API_KEY=... ORBIT_WORKSPACE_ID=... CIRCLE_API_KEY=... CIRCLE_URL=... bundle exec circle_orbit --check-posts
```

To check for new comments on posts:

```bash
$ ORBIT_API_KEY=... ORBIT_WORKSPACE_ID=... CIRCLE_API_KEY=... CIRCLE_URL=... bundle exec circle_orbit --check-comments
```

**Add the `--historical-import` flag to your CLI command to perform a historical import of all your Circle interactions using the CLI.**

## GitHub Actions Automation Setup

âš¡ You can set up this integration in a matter of minutes using our GitHub Actions template. It will run regularly to add new activities to your Orbit workspace. All you need is a GitHub account.

[See our guide for setting up this automation](https://github.com/orbit-love/github-actions-templates/blob/main/Circle/README.md)
